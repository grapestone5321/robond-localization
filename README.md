Udacity Robond Localization project

# Where Am I?

## Project Overview
Welcome to the localization project! In this project, you will learn to utilize ROS packages to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a provided map in the Gazebo and RViz simulation environments.

Over the course of this lesson, you will learn about several aspects of robotics with a focus on ROS, including -

- Building a mobile robot for simulated tasks.

- Creating a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a Gazebo world and utilizes packages like AMCL and the Navigation Stack.

- Exploring, adding, and tuning specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results.

Note: Similar to project 1, you are required to document the work along the way. Use the project rubric as reference when you work through the project!
