# Where Am I?
Udacity Robond Localization project

## Project Overview
Welcome to the localization project! In this project, you will learn to utilize ROS packages to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a provided map in the Gazebo and RViz simulation environments.

Over the course of this lesson, you will learn about several aspects of robotics with a focus on ROS, including -

- Building a mobile robot for simulated tasks.

- Creating a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a Gazebo world and utilizes packages like AMCL and the Navigation Stack.

- Exploring, adding, and tuning specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results.

Note: Similar to project 1, you are required to document the work along the way. Use the project rubric as reference when you work through the project!


## Steps to complete the project
1. Follow the steps outlined in this Project Lesson, to create your own ROS package, develop a mobile robot model for Gazebo, and integrate the AMCL and Navigation ROS packages for localizing the robot in the provided map.

2. Using the Parameter Tuning section as the basis, add and tune parameters for your ROS packages to improve your localization results in the map provided. Feel free to explore new parameters using the resources provided earlier in the same section. Please include the image of RViz with the robot at goal position and the PoseArray displayed. Each run may take a long time so don't forget to screenshot your robot at the goal position!

3. After achieving the desired results for the robot model introduced in the lesson, implement your own robot model with significant changes to the robot's base and possibly sensor locations.

4. Check your previous parameter settings with your new robot model, and improve upon your localization results as required for this new robot.

5. Document your work. You could use this Writeup Template.
